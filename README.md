# Nazemux
Nazemux was Built With The Aim of Tracking Down Someone Who is Accused of Committing a Crime or Ripper

What can be done with Nazemux? and what's mechanism behind it?
- it runs with capturing someone camera and then the output file will automatically sent into your personal telegram bot server
- the output file will also be automatically deleted from its own local directory, so it won't be suspicious
